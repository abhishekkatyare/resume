## __Introduction__
I am an Engineer from Nashik, India who loves to develop digital systems and write software to make world more
digital. I am a coder by profession and entrepreneur by heart. I have a passion for creating and enhancing anything
related to the technology. When it comes to building something new, my ultimate goal is to make the world a better
place. I’m a digital professional on the bleeding edge technology. Strong engineering professional with a Bachelor of
Engineering (B.E.) focused in Computer Science and Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University.

I’m self-motivated, highly adaptable, intellectual, technology enthusiast, problem solver, persistent. Self-taught
many programming languages and new technologies. I’m enthusiastic to learn new technologies and I like trial and
error method to solve any problem. I like to experiment and research in Internet of Things(IoT), AI, Machine Learning,
Deep Learning, BigData, Distributed Computing & Parallel Programming.

I’m ”jugaadu” kind of person. So if you gave me challenge and time duration to find out solution to it. And if I don’t
know anything about it, then I just want one machine and full access of internet. I’ll do research, learn and develop the
solution for that challenge within the given time frame.

I’m also interested in entrepreneurship, critical reading, listening to music, traveling, trekking, hiking, street and
landscape photography.
