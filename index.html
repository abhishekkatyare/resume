<p>I‚Äôm an Engineer from Nashik, India who loves to develop digital systems and write software to make the world more digital. I am a coder by profession and entrepreneur by heart. I have a passion for creating and enhancing anything related to technology. When it comes to building something new, my ultimate goal is to make the world a better place. I‚Äôm a digital professional on the bleeding edge technology. Strong engineering professional with a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) focused on Computer Science and Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm self-motivated, highly adaptable, intellectual, technology enthusiast, problem solver, persistent. Self-taught many programming languages and new technologies. I‚Äôm enthusiastic to learn new technologies and I like the trial and error method to solve any problem. I like to experiment and research on the Internet of Things(IoT), AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, BigData, Distributed Computing &amp; Parallel Programming.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a ‚Äújugaadu‚Äù kind of person. So if you gave me a challenge and time duration to find out the solution to it. And if I don‚Äôt know anything about it, then I just want one machine and full access to the internet. I‚Äôll do research, learn, and develop the solution for that challenge within the given time frame.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also interested in entrepreneurship, critical reading, listening to music, traveling, trekking, hiking, street, and landscape photography.</p>
